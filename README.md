# CSV
I've created this CSV project because I was working on a website where all the data was saved as a CSV and I needed to convert it to JSON, .pickle and sometimes combine multiple CSV's

# How to use
Add the two .exe files to PATH on windows and then in command prompt type "csvtojson" or "csvtoone" in a folder that has a CSV file.

If you have multiple CSV files in the same folder, make sure that they all have the same column name.
